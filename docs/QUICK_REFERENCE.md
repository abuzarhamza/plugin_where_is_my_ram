# ðŸš€ Quick Reference - Chrome Store Justifications

## ðŸ“‹ Copy-Paste Justifications

### **activeTab Permission**
```
The activeTab permission is required to interact with the currently active tab when the user clicks the extension icon. This allows the extension to display memory usage information for the current tab and show tab-specific details in the popup interface. The extension only accesses the active tab when the user explicitly opens the extension popup. No data is collected or transmitted from the active tab.
```

### **tabs Permission**
```
The tabs permission is required to provide the core functionality of the extension: count the total number of open tabs, retrieve basic tab information (title, URL, ID) for memory tracking, display a list of all open tabs with their memory usage, and enable the "Kill Tabs" feature to close selected tabs. The extension only reads tab metadata and does not access tab content. No browsing data is collected or transmitted.
```

### **processes Permission**
```
The processes permission is required to access real memory usage data from Chrome's process information. This enables the extension to retrieve actual RAM consumption data for each tab process and provide accurate memory measurements instead of estimates. This permission is only used to read memory statistics and does not access any personal data or browsing content. The extension falls back to estimation algorithms when this API is not available.
```

### **Single Purpose Description**
```
This extension has a single, focused purpose: to help users monitor and manage their browser's memory usage by tracking RAM consumption of open tabs. The extension provides real-time memory usage monitoring, visual breakdown of RAM consumption per tab, and tools to identify and close memory-hungry tabs. All features are directly related to this core purpose of memory monitoring and tab management.
```

### **Remote Code Use**
```
This extension does not use any remote code execution. All functionality is implemented using standard Chrome Extension APIs and local JavaScript code bundled with the extension. No external scripts, remote code loading, or dynamic code execution from external sources is used. All code is static and included in the extension package.
```

### **Data Usage Compliance**
```
This extension complies with Chrome Web Store developer program policies: NO DATA COLLECTION (does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data), NO TRACKING (no user behavior tracking or analytics), NO EXTERNAL SERVERS (all processing happens locally), NO THIRD-PARTY SERVICES (no integration with external services), LOCAL PROCESSING ONLY (all memory calculations performed locally), NO PERSISTENT STORAGE (no data stored beyond current session).

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Points to Remember

1. **No Data Collection** - Emphasize this in all justifications
2. **Local Processing Only** - All calculations happen in browser
3. **Single Purpose** - Memory monitoring and tab management only
