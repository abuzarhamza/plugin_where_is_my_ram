# 🚀 Quick Chrome Web Store Submission Reference

## 📋 **Copy-Paste Ready Justifications**

### **activeTab Permission Justification:**
```
The extension requires the activeTab permission to open the Chrome Task Manager (chrome://task-manager/) when users click the "Chrome Task Manager" button. This permission allows the extension to create a new tab with the Task Manager URL, which is essential for the core functionality of providing users with access to Chrome's built-in memory monitoring tools.
```

### **Single Purpose Description:**
```
This extension provides a simple tab counter with quick access to Chrome's Task Manager for memory monitoring. The extension displays the total number of open tabs across all Chrome windows, shows when the last window was opened, and provides a convenient button to access Chrome's built-in Task Manager for detailed memory usage information. It helps users monitor their tab usage and quickly access Chrome's native memory management tools.
```

### **Data Usage Compliance:**
```
This extension does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data or browsing information. Tab count is calculated locally using Chrome's chrome.windows.getAll() API, and last window open time is stored locally in the extension's memory. No data is sent to external servers or stored persistently. The extension operates entirely locally within the user's browser.
```

### **Remote Code Usage:**
```
This extension does not use any remote code or external scripts. All functionality is implemented using local JavaScript files that are included in the extension package.
```
