# 🔧 Updated Chrome Web Store Requirements - Where Did My RAM Go? 🐑

## 📋 **Permission Justification**

### **activeTab Permission**
**Justification:** The extension requires the `activeTab` permission to open the Chrome Task Manager (`chrome://task-manager/`) when users click the "Chrome Task Manager" button. This permission allows the extension to create a new tab with the Task Manager URL, which is essential for the core functionality of providing users with access to Chrome's built-in memory monitoring tools.

**Usage:** The extension uses `chrome.tabs.create()` to open `chrome://task-manager/` in a new tab when the user clicks the Task Manager button in the popup interface.

## 🎯 **Single Purpose Description**

**Purpose:** This extension provides a simple tab counter with quick access to Chrome's Task Manager for memory monitoring.

**Description:** The extension displays the total number of open tabs across all Chrome windows, shows when the last window was opened, and provides a convenient button to access Chrome's built-in Task Manager for detailed memory usage information. It helps users monitor their tab usage and quickly access Chrome's native memory management tools.

## 📊 **Data Usage Compliance**

**Data Collection:** This extension does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data or browsing information.

**Data Processing:** 
- Tab count is calculated locally using Chrome's `chrome.windows.getAll()` API
- Last window open time is stored locally in the extension's memory
- No data is sent to external servers or stored persistently

**Privacy:** The extension operates entirely locally within the user's browser and does not access any personal information or browsing data beyond the basic tab count functionality.

## 🔒 **Remote Code Usage**

**Remote Code:** This extension does not use any remote code or external scripts.

**All Code:** All functionality is implemented using local JavaScript files that are included in the extension package.
