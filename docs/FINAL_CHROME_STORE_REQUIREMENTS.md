# 🔧 Final Chrome Web Store Requirements - Where Did My RAM Go? 🐑

## 📋 **Permission Justifications**

### **activeTab Permission**
**Justification:** The extension requires the `activeTab` permission to open the Chrome Task Manager help page when users click the "Task Manager" button. This permission allows the extension to create a new tab with the help page URL, which is essential for providing users with instructions on how to access Chrome's built-in memory monitoring tools.

**Usage:** The extension uses `chrome.tabs.create()` to open the help page in a new tab when the user clicks the Task Manager button in the popup interface.

### **tabs Permission**
**Justification:** The extension requires the `tabs` permission to provide comprehensive tab management functionality. This includes:
- Displaying a list of all open tabs with their titles, URLs, and staleness information
- Tracking when tabs were last accessed to calculate staleness
- Detecting duplicate tabs by comparing URLs
- Closing duplicate tabs to help users manage memory usage
- Switching to specific tabs when clicked in the tab list

**Usage:** The extension uses `chrome.tabs.query()`, `chrome.tabs.onActivated`, `chrome.tabs.onUpdated`, `chrome.tabs.onCreated`, `chrome.tabs.onRemoved`, `chrome.tabs.update()`, and `chrome.tabs.remove()` APIs to provide these tab management features.

## 🎯 **Single Purpose Description**

**Purpose:** This extension provides comprehensive tab management with memory monitoring capabilities.

**Description:** The extension displays the total number of open tabs across all Chrome windows, shows when the last window was opened, provides a detailed list of all tabs with staleness tracking, detects and removes duplicate tabs to save memory, and offers quick access to Chrome's built-in Task Manager for detailed memory usage information. It helps users monitor their tab usage, identify stale tabs, remove duplicates, and quickly access Chrome's native memory management tools.

## 📊 **Data Usage Compliance**

**Data Collection:** This extension does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data or browsing information.

**Data Processing:** 
- Tab count is calculated locally using Chrome's `chrome.tabs.query()` API
- Tab staleness is tracked locally using timestamps stored in memory
- Last window open time is stored locally in the extension's memory
- Duplicate detection is performed locally by comparing URLs
- No data is sent to external servers or stored persistently

**Privacy:** The extension operates entirely locally within the user's browser and does not access any personal information or browsing data beyond the basic tab management functionality required for its core features.

## 🔒 **Remote Code Usage**

**Remote Code:** This extension does not use any remote code or external scripts.

**All Code:** All functionality is implemented using local JavaScript files that are included in the extension package.
