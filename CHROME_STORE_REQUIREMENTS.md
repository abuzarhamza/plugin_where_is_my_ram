# üè™ Chrome Web Store Submission Requirements

## üìã Required Justifications

### **1. Permission Justifications**

#### **activeTab Permission**
```
Justification: The activeTab permission is required to interact with the currently active tab when the user clicks the extension icon. This allows the extension to:

‚Ä¢ Display memory usage information for the current tab
‚Ä¢ Show tab-specific details in the popup interface
‚Ä¢ Provide context-aware functionality when the user opens the extension

The extension only accesses the active tab when the user explicitly opens the extension popup. No data is collected or transmitted from the active tab.
```

#### **tabs Permission**
```
Justification: The tabs permission is required to provide the core functionality of the extension:

‚Ä¢ Count the total number of open tabs across all windows
‚Ä¢ Retrieve basic tab information (title, URL, ID) for memory tracking
‚Ä¢ Display a list of all open tabs with their memory usage
‚Ä¢ Enable the "Kill Tabs" feature to close selected tabs
‚Ä¢ Track when tabs were last accessed for memory estimation

The extension only reads tab metadata (title, URL, ID) and does not access tab content. No browsing data is collected or transmitted.
```

#### **processes Permission**
```
Justification: The processes permission is required to access real memory usage data from Chrome's process information:

‚Ä¢ Retrieve actual RAM consumption data for each tab process
‚Ä¢ Provide accurate memory measurements instead of estimates
‚Ä¢ Enable precise memory tracking for better user experience
‚Ä¢ Support the core functionality of showing "where RAM goes"

This permission is only used to read memory statistics and does not access any personal data or browsing content. The extension falls back to estimation algorithms when this API is not available.
```

### **2. Single Purpose Description**
```
Single Purpose: This extension has a single, focused purpose: to help users monitor and manage their browser's memory usage by tracking RAM consumption of open tabs.

The extension provides:
‚Ä¢ Real-time memory usage monitoring for all open tabs
‚Ä¢ Visual breakdown of RAM consumption per tab
‚Ä¢ Tools to identify and close memory-hungry tabs
‚Ä¢ Performance optimization through tab management

All features are directly related to this core purpose of memory monitoring and tab management. The extension does not perform any unrelated functions or collect data for purposes other than memory tracking.
```

### **3. Remote Code Use Justification**
```
Remote Code Use: This extension does not use any remote code execution. All functionality is implemented using:

‚Ä¢ Standard Chrome Extension APIs (chrome.tabs, chrome.processes, chrome.action)
‚Ä¢ Local JavaScript code bundled with the extension
‚Ä¢ No external scripts or remote code loading
‚Ä¢ No dynamic code execution from external sources
‚Ä¢ No eval() or similar dynamic code execution

All code is static and included in the extension package. No remote resources are loaded or executed.
```

### **4. Data Usage Compliance**
```
Data Usage Compliance: This extension complies with Chrome Web Store developer program policies:

‚Ä¢ NO DATA COLLECTION: The extension does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data
‚Ä¢ NO TRACKING: No user behavior tracking or analytics
‚Ä¢ NO EXTERNAL SERVERS: All processing happens locally in the browser
‚Ä¢ NO THIRD-PARTY SERVICES: No integration with external services
‚Ä¢ LOCAL PROCESSING ONLY: All memory calculations are performed locally
‚Ä¢ NO PERSISTENT STORAGE: No data is stored beyond the current browser session

The extension only uses the requested permissions to provide its core functionality of memory monitoring and tab management.
```
